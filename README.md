# RevitBlockchain

## Blockchain-based Change Tracking and Audit System for Autodesk Revit

RevitBlockchain creates an immutable audit trail of all changes in BIM projects by integrating blockchain technology directly into Autodesk Revit workflows. Every sync to central becomes a blockchain transaction, creating unprecedented accountability and traceability in collaborative design.

### 🎯 Core Value Proposition

- **Immutable Audit Trail**: Every change is permanently recorded with who, what, when, and why
- **Conflict Resolution**: Clear ownership history resolves disputes instantly
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Automated tracking for liability and compliance requirements
- **Design Decision History**: Track not just changes, but the reasoning behind them
- **Workset Smart Contracts**: Automated rules for ownership and approval workflows

### 🏗️ How It Works

1. **Revit Add-in** hooks into central file synchronization events
2. **Blockchain Transactions** are created for every sync operation
3. **Smart Contracts** enforce workset ownership and approval rules
4. **MCP Integration** connects to existing blockchain infrastructure
5. **Audit Reports** can be generated at any time for any element

### 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SamuraiBuddha/RevitBlockchain.git

# Build the add-in
cd RevitBlockchain
msbuild RevitBlockchain.csproj /p:Configuration=Release

# Deploy to Revit
.\deploy-to-revit.ps1
```

### 📋 Prerequisites

- Revit 2024 or later
- .NET Framework 4.8
- Access to MCP Blockchain server (or local test instance)
- Visual Studio 2022 (for development)

### 💡 Vision

> "What if every Revit element had a wallet address?"

While that might sound extreme, the core idea is sound: create an immutable, cryptographically-secure record of every change in a BIM project. This isn't just about tracking—it's about creating a new paradigm for accountability and collaboration in architecture and construction.
